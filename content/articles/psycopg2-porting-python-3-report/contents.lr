I've mostly finished the porting of psycopg2 to Python 3. Here is a
report of what done and what can be improved.

.. CUT-HERE

The code is available in the python3 branch of the repository
available on <https://github.com/dvarrazzo/psycopg>. The code is
compatible with both python2 and python3: the Python code is in py2
syntax: setup.py processes it with 2to3 before installation. The C
code uses a macros portability layer (in ``psycopg/python.h``) to have py2
and py3 code unified.

A big chunk of the porting is by Martin von LÃ¶wis (who I thank
wholeheartedly): who provided a big patch back in 2008 (against 2.0.9,
IIRC). Unfortunately psycopg code diverged without the patch being
merged or maintained, so I basically used his macros but re-did the
work from scratch, refactoring the code instead of patching many
repetitive parts. On the pro side, since then, psycopg gained many
more tests.

Large part of the porting has been mechanical, nothing to say about
that. What has required decisions has been instead the string
processing: Py3 uses extensively Unicode, but the communication with
the libpq is performed in char*; being psycopg a programmable
interface the point in which the conversion happens changes how
adapters and typecasters should be written.

Adapters
------------

they are objects wrapping any Python object and returning a SQL
representation to be passed to the libpq. The adapters may have
returned either a str or an unicode, but a critical step is to pass
through libpq functions to have string and binary data escaped (e.g.
PQescapeStringConn). Because these functions are defined char* ->
char*, what makes sense for me was to force adapters to return bytes:
having them returning unicode would mean that unicode strings should
have been:

- converted to bytes
- escaped by the libpq
- converted back to unicode to be returned from the adapter (but at this point which encoding to use is not clear)
- merged to the query
- converted to bytes again to be sent to the socket

The double encoding seems unnecessary, so I prefer to have adapters to
return bytes. Having them free to return either bytes or unicode makes
writing composite adapters trickier and more error prone, so my
decision is to raise an exception if after adaptation a non-bytes
object is returned.

Having adapted objects as bytes means that the arguments must be
merged to the query as bytes: this operation is performed by not much
more than a ``query % args``. Unfortunately the % operator is not
available for bytes, so I have ported the ``PyString_Format`` from Python
2.7 and adapted to work with the bytes (the Python license seems
allowing mixing derived code with the LGPL without problems).

Typecasters
----------------

These are function performing the opposite: they take the PostgreSQL
representation of a value and convert it into a Python object. They
receive bytes from the libpq of course. What I have currently
implemented is to convert this string to unicode before passing it to
the Python functions: because in Python the parsing functions mostly
take strings as argument (meaning unicode in py3), passing bytes to the typecasters would have meant that each of them
should have implemented about the same boilerplate, something like::

   def caster(value, curs):
       value = value.decode(
           psycopg.encodings[curs.connection.encoding])

but only in Py3, not in Py2. The current approach (passing an already decoded object) makes writing the typecasters easier, but has the drawback of making
impossible to write a Python typecaster for a binary type (but I don't
think there is really the need for such caster) and it is kinda
inconsistent with the adapters (dealing with bytes). What option would be better?

COPY
--------

Copy operations deal with Python files or file-like objects. In input
(COPY IN) both unicode and bytes files are accepted; unicode is
converted in the connection encoding. In output (COPY OUT)... oops:
reviewing now I see I've overlooked this part: as it is now the data
(bytes) from the libpq are passed to ``file.write()`` using
``PyObject_CallFunction(func, "s#", buffer, len)``. But this implies that
buffer is decoded from utf8 in Py3, so it would break if the
connection encoding was different. I've done a quick check and in Py3
a file open in text mode doesn't accept bytes, while one open in
binary mode doesn't accept unicode. Uhm... what could we pass this
file? Is there an interface in Python 3 to know if a file is binary or
text? Added ticket `#36 <https://psycopg.lighthouseapp.com/projects/62710/tickets/36>`__.

Large Objects
------------------

These are open using a mode string such as "r", "w", "rw". I have
added a format letter pretty much as the open() function in Py3: it
can be "b" or "t". In binary mode the file always returns bytes (str
in py2, bytes [edit: not unicode] in py3). In text mode it always returns unicode
(unicode in py2, str in py3). The default is "b" in py2, "t" in py3.
writing to the file accepts both str and unicode. This means that in
Py2 everything is compatible, but there are a few features added
(unicode communication) and it's easy to write portable code by
specifying the mode "b" or "t".

Other random details
--------------------------

- in py2 psycopg uses basic string as default, and unicode must be chosen specifically (e.g. registering the adapter, passing a unicode=True to certain functions etc.) In py3 there is no such choice and unicode is returned where there used to be a choice.
- bytea fields are returned as MemoryView, from which is easy to get bytes.
- "secondary strings" (notices, notifications, errors...) are decoded in the connection encoding, but I'm not be 100% sure that this will be always right, so the decoding is forgiving: decode(x, 'replace') for them.

This should be pretty much everything about the Py3 porting. Comments
are welcome, above all on the open points (typecasters and COPY OUT),
but if there is anything to point out I'd be happy to know. Best option would be to discuss on the `mailing list <https://mail.postgresql.org/mj/mj_wwwusr/domain=postgresql.org?func=lists-long-full&extra=psycopg>`__. See you there!

**Update:** `Psycopg 2.4 beta 1 has been released </articles/2011/02/06/psycopg-24-beta1-released/>`__ with Python 3 support.
