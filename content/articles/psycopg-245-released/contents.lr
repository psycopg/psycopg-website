What's new in psycopg 2.4.5
---------------------------

- The ``close()`` methods on connections and cursors don't raise
  exceptions
  if called on already closed objects.
- Fixed ``fetchmany()`` with no argument in cursor subclasses
  (ticket #84).
- Use ``lo_creat()`` instead of ``lo_create()`` when possible for better
  interaction with pgpool-II (ticket #88).
- ``Error`` and its subclasses are picklable, useful for multiprocessing
  interaction (ticket #90).
- Better efficiency and formatting of timezone offset objects thanks
  to Menno Smits (tickets #94, #95).
- Fixed ``rownumber`` during iteration on cursor subclasses.
  Regression introduced in 2.4.4 (ticket #100).
- Added support for ``inet`` arrays.
- Fixed ``commit()`` concurrency problem (ticket #103).
- Codebase cleaned up using the `GCC Python plugin <https://fedorahosted.org/gcc-python-plugin/>`__\ 's `static analysis tool <https://readthedocs.org/docs/gcc-python-plugin/en/latest/cpychecker.html>`__, which has revealed several unchecked return values, possible
  NULL dereferences, reference counting problems. Many thanks to David
  Malcolm for the useful tool and the assistance provided using it.
