After a long while Psycopg has a Mailing List again!

You are welcome to subscribe__, either if you are an user dealing with the first stumbling blocks (albeit a look at the documentation_ or the FAQ_ wouldn't hurt!) or if you want to contribute to the psycopg2 development, about which there are several upcoming news.

.. __: https://mail.postgresql.org/mj/mj_wwwusr/domain=postgresql.org?func=lists-long-full&extra=psycopg
.. _documentation: /docs/
.. _faq: /docs/faq.html

To post, send mail to <psycopg@postgresql.org>. Yes, we are proud to be hosted on the mighty shoulders of the **PostgreSQL Infrastructure team**. I want to thank them and the **PostgreSQL Global Development Group** wholeheartedly for making this happen.

See you there!
