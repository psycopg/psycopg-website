What's new in psycopg 2.4.1
---------------------------

- Use own parser for bytea output, not requiring anymore the libpq 9.0
  to parse the hex format.
- Don't fail connection if the client encoding is a non-normalized
  variant. Issue reported by Peter Eisentraut.
- Correctly detect an empty query sent to the backend (`ticket #46 <https://psycopg.lighthouseapp.com/projects/62710/tickets/46>`__).
- Fixed a SystemError clobbering libpq errors raised without SQLSTATE.
  Bug vivisectioned by Eric Snow.
- Fixed interaction between NamedTuple and server-side cursors.
- Allow to specify --static-libpq on setup.py command line instead of
  just in 'setup.cfg'. Patch provided by Matthew Ryan (`ticket #48 <https://psycopg.lighthouseapp.com/projects/62710/tickets/46>`__).
