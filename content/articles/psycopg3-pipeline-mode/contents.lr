`Version 3.1`_ of Psycopg added support for `libpq pipeline mode`_, bringing
significant performance boost, especially when network latency is important.
In this article, we’ll briefly describe how it works from users’ perspective
and *under the hood* while also providing a few implementation details.

.. CUT-HERE

Supporting `libpq pipeline mode`_ involved significant changes to the query
processing logic in the driver. Yet, the challenge was to make it compatible
with the “normal” query mode in order to keep the API almost unchanged and
thus bring performance benefits to users without exposing the complexity of
the batch query mode.

For the impatient, head out to the `pipeline mode`_ documentation of
Psycopg: it’s self-consistent, explains nicely the details for
client/server communication, as well as how things work from the user’s
perspective.

Using the pipeline mode in Psycopg
==================================

``Connection`` objects gained a `pipeline()`_ method to enable the
pipeline mode through a context manager (`with statement`_); so
using it is as simple as:

.. code:: python

   conn = psycopg.connect()
   with conn.pipeline():
      # do work

What is the pipeline mode for?
==============================

`Postgres documentation`_ contains advices on when the pipeline mode is
useful. One particular case is when the application is doing many write
operations (``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``).

For instance, let’s consider the following schema:

.. code:: sql

   CREATE TABLE t (x numeric, d timestamp, p boolean)

and assume an application does a lot of queries like:

.. code:: sql

   INSERT INTO t (x, d, p) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)

with distinct values. Maybe the application could make use of batch inserts
such as `executemany()`_, maybe not (e.g. because it needs to do some other
operations between inserts, like querying another resource): this does not
matter much.

Let’s put this together into a little ``demo.py`` Python program:

.. code:: python

   import math
   import sys
   from datetime import datetime
   import psycopg

   def create_table(conn: psycopg.Connection) -> None:
       conn.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t")
       conn.execute("CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE t (x numeric, d timestamp, p boolean)")

   def do_insert(conn: psycopg.Connection, *, pipeline: bool, count: int = 1000) -> None:
       query = "INSERT INTO t (x, d, p) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)"
       for n in range(count):
           params = (math.factorial(n), datetime.now(), pipeline)
           conn.execute(query, params, prepare=True)

   with psycopg.connect(autocommit=True) as conn:
       create_table(conn)
       if "--pipeline" in sys.argv:
           with conn.pipeline():
               do_insert(conn, pipeline=True)
       else:
           do_insert(conn, pipeline=False)
       row_count = conn.execute("select count(*) from t").fetchone()[0]
       print(f"→ {row_count} rows")

we’ll run our script as ``python demo.py [--pipeline]``, the
``--pipeline`` flag allowing to enable pipeline mode. Note that we
passed ``prepare=True`` to ``Connection.execute()``, in order to issue a
``PREPARE`` statement as we’ll emit the same query many times.

In general, each ``INSERT`` query will be fast to execute server-side.
Without the pipeline mode enabled, the client will typically issue the
query and then wait for its result (though it is unused here): thus the
client/server round-trip time will probably be much larger than the
execution time (on server). With the pipeline mode, we basically save
these round-trips most of the times.

Interlude: tracing
==================

When working on optimizing client/server communication, it’s essential
to be able to monitor this communication at a reasonably *low level*.
From Psycopg’s perspective, the boundary is the libpq. Fortunately, the
library provides a tracing mechanism through the `PQtrace`_ function and
friends.

The output of this function looks like (example taken from the
`PostgreSQL test suite`_):

::

   F   68  Parse    "select_one" "SELECT $1, '42', $1::numeric, interval '1 sec'" 1 NNNN
   F   16  Describe     S "select_one"
   F   4   Sync
   B   4   ParseComplete
   B   10  ParameterDescription     1 NNNN
   B   113 RowDescription   4 "?column?" NNNN 0 NNNN 4 -1 0 "?column?" NNNN 0 NNNN 65535 -1 0 "numeric" NNNN 0 NNNN 65535 -1 0 "interval" NNNN 0 NNNN 16 -1 0
   B   5   ReadyForQuery    I
   F   10  Query    "BEGIN"
   B   10  CommandComplete  "BEGIN"
   B   5   ReadyForQuery    T
   F   43  Query    "DECLARE cursor_one CURSOR FOR SELECT 1"
   B   19  CommandComplete  "DECLARE CURSOR"
   B   5   ReadyForQuery    T
   F   16  Describe     P "cursor_one"
   F   4   Sync
   B   33  RowDescription   1 "?column?" NNNN 0 NNNN 4 -1 0
   B   5   ReadyForQuery    T
   F   4   Terminate

Each row contains the “direction indicator” (``F`` for messages from
client to server or ``B`` for messages from server to client), the
message length, the `message type`_, and its content. This example shows
messages from the `Extended Query`_ protocol.

In Psycopg, we have access to the low-level `PGconn`_ object,
representing the libpq connection, through `Connection.pgconn`_
attribute.

Here’s how to enable tracing to ``stderr``, for our ``demo.py`` program
above:

.. code:: python

   from contextlib import contextmanager
   from typing import Iterator
   from psycopg import pq

   @contextmanager
   def trace_to_stderr(conn: psycopg.Connection) -> Iterator[None]:
       """Enable tracing of the client/server communication to STDERR."""
       conn.pgconn.trace(sys.stderr.fileno())
       conn.pgconn.set_trace_flags(pq.Trace.SUPPRESS_TIMESTAMPS | pq.Trace.REGRESS_MODE)
       try:
           yield
       finally:
           conn.pgconn.untrace()

   def do_insert(conn: psycopg.Connection, *, pipeline: bool, count: int = 1000) -> None:
       # ...
       with trace_to_stderr(conn):
           for _ in range(count):
               conn.execute(query, params, prepare=True)

To pipeline or not to pipeline
==============================

If we run our demo script (without pipeline mode), we’ll typically get
the following output:

::

   F   69  Parse    "_pg3_0" "INSERT INTO t (x, d, p) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)" 3 NNNN NNNN NNNN
   F   4   Sync
   B   4   ParseComplete
   B   5   ReadyForQuery    I
   F   49  Bind     "" "_pg3_0" 3 1 1 1 3 2 '\x00\x01' 8 '\x00\x02\xffffff8b\xffffff8fp~WN' 1 '\x00' 1 0
   F   6   Describe     P ""
   F   9   Execute  "" 0
   F   4   Sync
   B   4   BindComplete
   B   4   NoData
   B   15  CommandComplete  "INSERT 0 1"
   B   5   ReadyForQuery    I
   F   49  Bind     "" "_pg3_0" 3 1 1 1 3 2 '\x00\x01' 8 '\x00\x02\xffffff8b\xffffff8fp~^\xffffff80' 1 '\x00' 1 0
   F   6   Describe     P ""
   F   9   Execute  "" 0
   F   4   Sync
   B   4   BindComplete
   B   4   NoData
   B   15  CommandComplete  "INSERT 0 1"
   B   5   ReadyForQuery    I
   [ ... and so forth ~1000 more times ... ]

we indeed see the client/server *round-trips* in the form of sequences
of ``F`` messages followed by sequences of ``B`` messages for each
query.

The first message sequence ``Parse``\ +\ ``ParseComplete`` corresponds
to the ``PREPARE`` statement. Next ones only have a
``Bind``/``Describe``/``Execute`` client messages followed by server
response.

Now using the pipeline mode (run the script with ``--pipeline``), we get
the following trace:

::

    F	69	Parse	 "_pg3_0" "INSERT INTO t (x, d, p) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)" 3 NNNN NNNN NNNN
    F	49	Bind	 "" "_pg3_0" 3 1 1 1 3 2 '\x00\x00' 8 '\x00\x02\xffffff8e<k\x0c\x16\xffffffe6' 1 '\x01' 1 0

    F	49	Bind	 "" "_pg3_0" 3 1 1 1 3 2 '\x00\x01' 8 '\x00\x02\xffffff8e<k\x0c\x18\xffffffcd' 1 '\x01' 1 0
    F	6	Describe	 P ""
    F	9	Execute	 "" 0

    F	6	Describe	 P ""
    F	9	Execute	 "" 0
    [ ... ~300 more of those ... ]
    B	4	ParseComplete
    B	4	BindComplete
    B	4	NoData
    B	15	CommandComplete	 "INSERT 0 1"
    B	4	BindComplete
    B	4	NoData
    B	15	CommandComplete	 "INSERT 0 1"
    B	4	BindComplete
    B	4	NoData
    B	15	CommandComplete	 "INSERT 0 1"
    [ ... ~300 more of those ... ]
    F	49	Bind	 "" "_pg3_0" 3 1 1 1 3 2 '\x01<' 8 '\x00\x02\xffffff8e<k\x0c\xffffff96\xffffff8a' 1 '\x01' 1 0
    F	6	Describe	 P ""
    F	9	Execute	 "" 0
    F	49	Bind	 "" "_pg3_0" 3 1 1 1 3 2 '\x01=' 8 '\x00\x02\xffffff8e<k\x0c\xffffff9c'' 1 '\x01' 1 0
    F	6	Describe	 P ""

    F	49	Bind	 "" "_pg3_0" 3 1 1 1 3 2 '\x01>' 8 '\x00\x02\xffffff8e<k\x0c\xffffff9c\xffffff85' 1 '\x01' 1 0
    F	6	Describe	 P ""
    F	9	Execute	 "" 0
    [ ... ]

We can see that the client sends more than 900 messages before the
server replies (with the same number of messages). Clearly, this can
have a huge impact on performance, especially when network latency
matters. And indeed, this runs twice faster even though the Postgres
server is on ``localhost``!

What’s actually happening is that the client sends as many queries as
possible, until the server decides it cannot manage more (in general
because its output buffer is full, typically here because of the large
integers we’re inserting), at which point the server sends back the
results of all queries; rinse and repeat. Instead of producing small and
frequent client/server round-trips, the pipeline mode optimizes network
communication by producing large and scarce round-trips. The “downside”
(remember we got a 2x speed-up) is that the client program needs to
handle more data in memory in general.

How does it work?
=================

As mentioned earlier, the entry point for the pipeline mode is the
`pipeline()`_ method on ``Connection`` object which enters and exists
pipeline mode. But what does this mean? Well, basically, this involves
calling underlying `PQ{enter,exit}PipelineMode`_ functions.

But this does not tell much about how things work in Psycopg.

To actually understand how things work, we need to step back and read
`libpq pipeline mode`_ documentation, in which section “Interleaving
Result Processing and Query Dispatch” states:

    The client application should generally maintain a queue of work remaining
    to be dispatched and a queue of work that has been dispatched but not yet
    had its results processed. When the socket is writable it should dispatch
    more work. When the socket is readable it should read results and process
    them, matching them up to the next entry in its corresponding results
    queue.

As often with PostgreSQL, everything is there although this paragraph is
somehow enigmatic. However, it, in fact, describes the heart of the
algorithm for the Psycopg driver (though it took us a while to grasp all
the details implied by these few sentences…).

Socket communication
--------------------

   When the socket is writable it should dispatch more work. When the
   socket is readable it should read results […].

In Psycopg, socket communication for exchanging libpq messages is
implemented through *waiting functions* and *generators* that are tied
together by the I/O layer (either blocking or async): this is explained
in details in `Daniele’s blog post`_.

What’s important for the pipeline mode (mostly) is the generator part,
as it is responsible for *dispatching queries to* or *reading results
from* the socket. In contrast with normal query mode, where these steps
are handled sequentially by independent logic, the pipeline mode needs
*interleaving result processing and query dispatch*: this is implemented
by the `pipeline_communicate()`_ generator. Without going too much into
the details, we can notice that: - the function takes a *queue* of
“commands”, e.g. `pgconn.send_query_params()`_ or similar, - it
continuously waits for the socket to be either Read or Write ready (or
both) (``ready = yield Wait.RW``), - when the socket is Read-ready
(``if ready & Ready.R:``), results are fetched (calling
`pgconn.get_result()`_), - when the socket is Write-ready
(``if ready & Ready.W:``), commands are sent (calling `pgconn.flush()`_
to flush the queue of previously sent commands, and then calling any
pending one), - until the queue of commands gets empty.

Queueing work, processing results
---------------------------------

Around the ``pipeline_communicate()`` generator described above, we need
to handle the commands queue as well as the queue of results pending
processing. The first part, filling the commands queue, is simply
managed by stacking commands instead of directly calling them along with
keeping a reference of the cursor used for ``execute()``. The second
part implies handling the output of `pipeline_communicate()`_ generator
described above, a list of `PGresult`_. Each fetched result item: - is
possibly bound back to its respective cursor (the one where respective
``execute()`` originates from), - might trigger an error if its status
is non-``OK`` (e.g. ``FATAL_ERROR``).

All this is handled in methods of the `BasePipeline`_ class (see methods
prefixed with an ``_`` at the end).

Integration with high-level features: transactions
==================================================

Beside the low-level logic described above, implementing pipeline mode
in Psycopg implied handling some Psycopg-specific features such as:
transactions.

Transactions need special attention because of how `error handling`_
works in the pipeline mode. There is a few distinct cases that need to
be handled properly, depending on whether the pipeline uses an *implicit
transaction* or if it contains *explicit transactions*. But the general
rule is that when an error occurs, the pipeline gets in *aborted* state
meaning subsequent commands are skipped and prior statements might get
persisted or not (depending on the usage of explicit transactions or
not).

Consider the following statements, executed within a pipeline:

.. code:: sql

   BEGIN;  # transaction 1
   INSERT INTO s VALUES ('abc');
   COMMIT;
   BEGIN;  # transaction 2
   INSERT INTO no_such_table VALUES ('x');
   ROLLBACK;
   BEGIN;  # transaction 3
   INSERT INTO s VALUES ('xyz');
   COMMIT;

   SELECT * from s;
   -> abc

The ``INSERT INTO no_such_table`` statement would produce an error,
making the pipeline **aborted**; accordingly, the following explicit
``ROLLBACK`` will not be executed. And the next statements (“transaction
3”) will also be skipped.

Another example:

.. code:: sql

   BEGIN;  # main transaction
   INSERT INTO s VALUES ('abc');
   BEGIN;  # sub-transaction
   INSERT INTO no_such_table VALUES ('x');
   ROLLBACK;
   INSERT INTO s VALUES ('xyz');
   COMMIT;

   SELECT * from s;
   -> []

Here, still due to the same error in ``INSERT INTO no_such_table``, the
final ``COMMIT`` statement is not executed and the main (outer)
transaction is not committed (despite the inner sub-transaction is
explicitly rolled back).

That’s typically something the user of a high level driver would not
want.

In Psycopg, transactions are managed explicitly through the
`transaction()`_ context manager method on ``Connection`` objects. So to
preserve a consistent behaviour, its logic needed to be adapted for the
pipeline mode. This got achieved by leveraging synchronization points
through `PQpipelineSync`_ and nested pipelines.

Nested pipelines
----------------

In the libpq, there is no such thing as a nested pipeline as the
connection can only enter pipeline mode once. What’s referred to as a
“nested pipeline” in Psycopg is the operation to “isolate” a sequence of
commands in a pipeline session through synchronization points. By doing
so, we work around the surprising behaviour described above (where a
committed transaction got rolled back). Here’s what happens:

.. code:: python

   with conn.pipeline():  # emits PQenterPipelineMode
     conn.execute(...)
     with conn.pipeline():  # emits PQpipelineSync
       conn.execute(...)
     # exiting the inner 'with' block emits PQpipelineSync
   # exiting the outermost 'with' block emits PQexitPipelineMode

The `PQpipelineSync`_ operation *resets* the pipeline state, thus
allowing subsequent commands to be run independently of whether previous
ones succeeded or not. (It also triggers results to be sent back from
the server, but that’s another matter.)

Pipelined transactions
----------------------

By using nested pipelines for Psycopg transactions, we typically follow
the “logical unit of work” pattern that’s mentioned in `libpq pipeline
mode`_ documentation:

   Pipelines should be scoped to logical units of work, usually (but not
   necessarily) one transaction per pipeline.

(Except that we’re not strictly use one pipeline per transaction, rather
a nested one.)

In practice, it means that it’s safe to use ``with transaction():``
block within a pipeline session as the semantics of both the transaction
and the pipeline are preserved: the transaction either succeeds or fails
overall, it only gets executed if previous commands in the pipeline
session succeeded:

.. code:: python

   with conn.pipeline():
     conn.execute(...)
     try:
         with conn.transaction():  # implicit nested pipeline (with conn.pipeline())
             conn.execute(...)
     finally:
         # This will be executed independently of whether the previous
         # transaction succeeded or not.
         conn.execute(...)

So back to the (second) example above, if written using Psycopg:

.. code:: python

   >>> with psycopg.connect(autocommit=True):
   ...     with conn.pipeline():
   ...         with conn.transaction():
   ...             conn.execute("INSERT INTO s VALUES (%s)", ("abc",))
   ...             try:
   ...                 with conn.transaction():
   ...                     conn.execute("INSERT INTO no_such_table VALUES (%s)", ("x",))
   ...             except errors.UndefinedTable:
   ...                 pass
   ...             conn.execute("INSERT INTO s VALUES (%s)", ("xyz",))
   ...     conn.execute("SELECT * FROM s ).fetchall()
   [('abc',), ('xyz',)]

we indeed get the inner transaction rolled back, and the outer one
committed, just like without the pipeline mode.

That’s an implementation detail, the user does not need to know about
this as the overall behaviour is hopefully natural.

--------------

Supporting libpq pipeline mode in Psycopg was a large milestone. It
required months of work with a lot of thinking and testing. There is
probably more to say about it, like how it transparently manages
`automatic prepared statement`_ or how `executemany()`_ got optimized to
use the pipeline mode implicitly (try adapting the demo script above to
use it — hint: no need for the ``with pipeline:`` block). And be sure to
read the Psycopg’s `pipeline mode`_ documentation soon!
