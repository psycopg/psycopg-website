title: Psycopg features
---
body:

Psycopg is written mostly in C and wraps the `libpq`_ library with the result of being both fast and secure.

..
  Please keep consistent with install.rst and setup.py

- Currently supports Python from 3.6 to 3.10 (older versions
  are supported by previous psycopg versions: check the `change log`__ for
  details)

- Supports PostgreSQL versions from 7.4 to 14

- Fully compliant implementation of the Python `DB API specification`_ for
  database adapters

- Thread-safe: threads can use different connections or share the same
  connection

- `Asynchronous nonblocking I/O`__, also integrated with `coroutine-based
  libraries`__ (gevent_, Eventlet_, uGreen_)

- Adaptation__ of many Python objects to database type: tuples to records,
  lists to array, dictionaries to hstore, flexible JSON support

- Extendible with `new adapters`__ to convert Python objects to SQL syntax and
  typecasters__ to convert PostgreSQL types back into Python objects

- `Server-side cursors`__

- |COPY|__ support

- `Large objects`__ support

- Can send and receive `asynchronous notification`__

- Support for `two-phase commit`__
